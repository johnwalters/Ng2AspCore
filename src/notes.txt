To run your builds, you now need to do the following commands:
   - "npm run build" to build.
   - "npm test" to run unit tests.
   - "npm start" to serve the app using webpack-dev-server.
   - "npm run e2e" to run protractor.

Running the equivalent CLI commands will result in an error.

Pre-docker note.
